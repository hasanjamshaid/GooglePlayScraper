My only complaint, fix the internet connection dropped issue. This is driving me crazy. I wanna play the game but I can't due to the connection drop. I've uninstalled, cleared data, everything and still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX!\",\n",
       "  \"Quite possibly one of the worst pool apps out there. The problem with free apps is that you get what you pay for, and if it's free, the developers probably have minimum skill. Basic angles and physics are completely void on this game. Gave it another chance and tried the block party. 9 games, never got to break, playing slop players that magically make shots by and sometimes thru balls. Balls that go opposite what they should, miraculously stop before going in or roll forever. Just irritating.\",\n",
       "  \"Ok, this game is fun to play with friends. But other than that, It's constantly trying to make you buy coins and throwing advertisements in your face, the little coin games you usually end up winning, but the big coin games somehow you get ripped off, I never had to charge a pool cue in my life, which I think is just really ridiculous in the game. To sum it all up, it's a good game to play while you're on the toilet 🚽\",\n",
       "  'Perfectly scripted. Puts you in a winning streak for a while. You have over 75000 chips. And then, all of a sudden you have 0. You spend \"money\" to \"buy\" chips stay in the game. This game is what ppl with addiction struggle against. It is a system that wants you to eventually use real money to stay in the game. It is counting on you to either continue to play or to pay to play if you overstay your welcome. I have reinstalled it twice already. This unistallment was the last . PPL,STAY AWAY !',\n",
       "  'Love the game,but the rules are so wrong,it would be better if you make your opponents ball in,you should take it out,give them the chance to let them win on there own.And people with higher levels should NOT be able to play at the low tables.This will make the game so much better.',\n",
       "  'Game is clearly rigged. You have to pay for the pool pass in order to win games. I play against all these random bots that never miss shots, come up with these ridiculous angles to pot the 8ball into pockets. Backspin concept is broken, I always seem to magically pot the cue ball. LOL this game is not enjoyable at all.',\n",
       "  \"App starts off fine. Tons of ads and popups to play, but at least it's free. Biggest complaint is the lines showing the path of the ball. It makes the game so incredibly easy and there's no modes that allow you to play with them off. It gets to the point where you join a match and cannot even play because the person hits everything in before your turn. Let alone its super easy to exploit the path with a piece of paper to make sure all your shots score. Such a stupid feature that kills the game.\",\n",
       "  \"The game is fun at first but I've had it for about a week. It was not loading so I uninstalled and re installed the game. I clicked connect to Facebook so I could play with parents, brother etc. And it won't load. If the people who made it could see what the issue is, it would be great\",\n",
       "  \"Always lose against people (really just A.I.) with crazy shots. They probably get some pic off the internet for the profile pics, the names are generic( Eric, Benjamin, Angela, etc.) and they don't miss a single shot. Like other reviews I've read, the tracking on the ball for the opponent is inhumane, it's way too fast and whenever the opponent shoots, they always make atleast one in. Uninstalling.\",\n",
       "  'This game is pretty fun but is a total money grab like everything else. \"Connection is slow\" is a bunch of horsesh!t... max out some cues then get more boxes only to get the same cue pieces over & over. 1 out of 12 or so actually needed. Don\\'t waste time and money on this snowjob like I did! Overall it\\'s addictive and fun but beware,KEEP YOUR MONEY! Enjoy it for what it is, a VIDEO GAME.',\n",
       "  \"Good game. However, I can tell when I'm playing their computer, and not a human. If you don't spend money, you won't do as well. If you hit the ball at full power, you will most likely scratch. It's amazing how the que ball goes traight into the CENTER of the pocket. I still like the game. It's too bad you have to buy yourself into a better position.\",\n",
       "  'Once you hit a certain coin count they take your money away so you have to pay. I ligitamently won 1.4 million coins from friends and how the game thinks that I used third party apps to gain coins in the game. I loved this game and played it for 2 years but now because of this I am likely gunna remove this app because of thier desire to make you pay real money in thier app. Only get the app if you are willing to have at any point your money ripped from you.',\n",
       "  \"Decent app, a ton of ads, borderline annoying though, especially for you to invest in their micro transactions, which definitely isn't happening without some sort of anti cheat/reporting system for suspected tampering. Seen a couple players over the past 50 or so make some ridiculous shots with inhuman precision, as if they eyeballed it instantly. Either they had a straight object on hand to align their shots (it's pathetic and ya'll know who you are,) or they have a molded version of the app.\",\n",
       "  \"The game would be great except the cues freeze now and then, tons of drop downs and ads. There's only so much you can do without spending money on numerous items. Every time I try to purchase something I get an error message. The game has become very frustrating.\",\n",
       "  \"Played pool for years. I've been in practice mode a couple weeks, almost all day. To get use to it before 1 on 1. But I won't bother. Balls react like pinball machine. NO ENGLISH on 95% of the shots. And the 5% you're able to use it, its terrible. You get a small amount on angle shots. But dead straight shots, there's like no backspin,(bottom hit) , and hardly any follow (top hit). You need to have English. ITS POOL TABLE NOT PINBALL GAME../ PEOPLE WATCH OUT FOR PLAYING AGAINST BOTS $$$$$\",\n",
       "  \"To be honest,even though I've given bad reviews in the past I play this game religiously 🤣and I've come to realize that there are gonna be hackers,cheaters,and Miniclip are probably doing there best to handle it, it's just so many of them out there,and there is no perfect game,and yes they got to ad you to death cause they ain't in business for free,so with that said, frustrating as it might be,I got to accept that I'm gonna loose,I'm gonna win,but most likely I'll keep playing.\",\n",
       "  'These are supposedly real people you\\'re playing against but you will watch the skill level go from nothing to masters in one shot. I think you play against bots and are \"allowed\" to win some games. Example: I won all of my games in the first two cities but am struggling to win a single game in Tokyo even though I\\'m playing against \"people\" that have not gone to in skill. Uninstalling this obvious, albeit well made, cash grab.',\n",
       "  'Someone who manages this app seems like a bottom feeder. Kind of strange how cue reaction changes in a game even though the cue is fully charged. Like someone is making sure i loose. Then when I\\'m just about to win, the \"connection is lost\" and i run out of time. Very frustrating this has happened several times playing for large stakes.',\n",
       "  \"AMAZING, CHECKS OUT! I have to mention that I've been changed the weekly fee of$ 7.99 for weeks and I never ordered this. I play daily is my favorite game that I've got installed. I'm so angry over this. I'm broke and this happening is embarrassing that I was changed over and over and over again. I'm miserable having to change my 5 stars to 3!\",\n",
       "  'I\\'m addicted to this amazingly fun game. I\\'ve been playing 8 ball by miniclip since 2019 and I used to get IRATE but Once you get past the fact that there are cheaters in every LIVE, PVP game there is, then you can have a good time and not worry about the cheaters. They will get theirs in the long run. Love this \"real\" game of pool 💯🤘',\n",
       "  \"Been playing this game for years and it keeps getting worse, the fact that u can skip a players turn to break 4 games in a row makes it unfair and there's no way to report players that cheat, allowing them to make illegal hits etc. If I lose I like to lose fair. It's hard to be competitive when the game is faulty, slow connection etc....its getting frustrating and so close to removing this game from my phone. Developers have a lot to fix to make the game fun again.\",\n",
       "  \"I like playing this game but the developers or whoever supposed to take care of it don't do it. This is the second time this has happened where takes 5000 points when I lose on a $100 game. Last time I had to completely uninstall the program and put it back on there. I'm not doing that again I'll just stop playing it. Fix it and I'll give you a better rating.\",\n",
       "  \"This game is usually my favorite but every time I use the app, its glitchy. Randomly shutting down or having to force stop it for some reason. I've bought things on the game and went to open my prize box but it glitched out and it took my money plus it didn't give me my prize.\",\n",
       "  'I joined the beta program and did not get the coins that I won but lost the coins for the games I lost. All in all the game is streaky you have winning streaks and losing streaks. The losing streaks clearly outnumber the winning streaks. This is clearly a rigged game. There is no way you could win 10 games in a row and then lose 20 in a row. Make it real please.',\n",
       "  \"Graphics are top notch, it's fun to play. But I've gathered from experimentation that to have better odds at breaking, winning tournaments or even getting more open shots, you have to buy their stuff... Which is a little bit a downer imo. But to each their own. I still be playing tho these silly algorithms be stacked against me.\",\n",

You should be able to aim first then call your shot. If it's 'cause you change your mind and you take another shot and get it it's unfair?Then you should block the shot or put that ball back and/or lose your turn, not turn on the aim thing after you call your shot. Why does the comment don't leave your opponent it waiting on something. Annoying sometimes\",\n",

No reporting system for people clearly cheating and when you are in a computer game for some reason you always seem to get the cue ball in the hole way too often bo matter how hard the shot or accurate.',\n",

Let's me break then clears it off my phone.\",\n",

I bought a 50000 coin pack which was supposed to double to 100000 per the annoying deal ads popping up in my face every 5 seconds, and only received the 50000 and customer service refused to acknowledge it let alone add the 50000 I'm owed then hassle me like I'M Wrong... I want a refund immediately and they're not even doing that I will be Putting this on social media and deleting this app soon....\",\n",

On top of that it matches you up with people who it isn't a fair play against when you start winning alot so that you spend money and then you start winning again. The game is rigged so unless you wanna spend money be prepared to lose.\",\n",
